# Ingenic Cloner Archives

This project mirrors official releases archived from `ftp.ingenic.com.cn`, providing easy access to important files for the community.

### Why 7zip Format?

GitHub imposes file size limits that prevent us from uploading large files directly. By using 7zip, we can split larger archives into smaller parts, making them easier to store and share.

## How to Use

1. **Download All Parts**: Each release is split into `.7z.001`, `.7z.002`, etc. Make sure to download all parts of the desired release.
2. **Extract**: Use `7zip` or a similar tool to extract the contents:
   ```bash
   7z x <archive_name>.7z.001
   ```
3. **Access the Files**: After extraction, you'll have access to the full archive and can use it as needed.
